config PINCTRL_NAME
	string "Pinctrl driver name"
	default "PINCTRL"
	help
	The name of the pinctrl driver.

config PINCTRL_INIT_PRIORITY
	int
	prompt "Init priority"
	default 2
	help
	  Pinctrl driver initialization priority.
	  Pinctrl driver almost certainly should be initialized before the
	  rest of hardware devices (which may need specific pins already
	  configured for them).
	  Thus, its priority should be between KERNEL_INIT_PRIORITY_DEFAULT
	  and KERNEL_INIT_PRIORITY_DEVICE. There are exceptions to this
	  rule for particular boards. Don't change this value unless you
	  know what you are doing.

config PINCTRL_PINMUX
	bool "Enable generic PINMUX interface for pinctrl drivers"
	default n
	help
	  Map PINMUX functions to PINCTRL functions.
	  Enables to use the PINMUX interface with pinctrl drivers.
	  This interface is for transition. Only use if necessary
	  by drivers calling this interface.

config PINCTRL_MUX_REQUEST
	bool "Enable management of pin allocation"
	default n
	help
	  Supports pin allocation management by pinctrl_mux_request() and
	  pinctrl_mux_free().
