The **general pupose input output** device driver deals with:

- input and output on **ports** and **pins**,
- interrupt generation on **pins**,
- configuration of **ports** and **pins**

General purpose input output concepts
*************************************

A **GPIO device driver**
    provides access to a GPIO *port*.

A GPIO **port**
    is a group of *pins* arranged in a group and controllable as a group.

A **pin**
    is the physical input/ output line of a chip. The pin
    numberspace is local [#pin_number_space]_ to a *port*. This
    pin space may be sparse - i.e. there may be gaps in the space with numbers
    where no pin exists.

GPIO device driver
******************

The GPIO device driver provides applications and other drivers to:

- read from a GPIO port or port pin,
- write to GPIO port or port pin,
- get signalled on GPIO port or port pin changes or interrupts.

Application programming interface
=================================

The GPIO device driver API is provided by :file:`include/gpio.h`.

The definition of GPIO pins differs slightly in case a PINCTRL device is
activated by ``CONFIG_PINCTRL``. Here generic pin defines are provided
for GPIO port pins. The pin defines allow to combine them to define
a set of pins.

If no PINCTRL device is activated the GPIO interface uses sequential
pin numbers that can not be combined to define a set of pins. This
legacy API is to be completely replaced by the PINCTRL variant when
all GPIO drivers have been migrated to use the pin controller device
for pin configuration.

Control properties
==================

Pins
----

The pins are defined in the generic GPIO include file
:file:`include/gpio_common.h` (eg. :c:macro:`GPIO_PORT_PIN0`).

The maximum number of pins managed by a GPIO port device driver is 32.

Pin Configuration
=================

Pin configuration by the GPIO pin configuration interface is deprecated.
Please use the PINCTRL pin configuration interface instead.

A generic set of GPIO port pin configuration properties is defined in
:file:`include/gpio.h`.
The GPIO pin configuration properties can be mapped to the generic pin
configuration properties of the PINCTRL device that controls the GPIO
port pins. A GPIO driver that is using the PINCTRL device to configure
the pins is just doing this.

**GPIO_DIR_IN**
    GPIO pin to be input.

    GPIO pin to be output.

    PINCTRL pin configuration property:

    - :c:macro:`PINCTRL_CONFIG_INPUT_ENABLE`,
    - :c:macro:`PINCTRL_CONFIG_OUTPUT_ENABLE`

Signalling Configuration
========================

Pin signalling can be configured by the general GPIO configuration interface.

:c:func:`gpio_pin_configure`
    Set the configuration of a pin.

A generic set of GPIO port pin signalling properties is defined in
:file:`include/gpio.h`. A GPIO driver may only support a subset of the
signalling properties.

**GPIO_INT**
    GPIO pin to trigger interrupt.

**GPIO_INT_ACTIVE_LOW**

GPIO device tree support
************************

Nodes
=====

GPIO Controller Node
--------------------

The GPIO device is defined by a GPIO controller node.

Required properties are:

- gpio-controller: Indicates this device is a GPIO controller
- compatible:
- label: Should be a name string


Interaction with the PINCTRL device driver
==========================================

To enable a pin controller to report the pins that are associated to a GPIO
device the gpio-ranges property shall be set in the device tree. Also the label
property shall be set and used as device name.

The gpio-ranges property is of the form:

.. code-block:: text

    gpio-ranges = <&[pin controller] [pin number in GPIO pin number space]
                                     [pin number in pin controller number space]
                                     [number of pins]>,
                                     /* ... */
                                     ;

A GPIO port definition in the device tree may look like:

.. code-block:: DTS

    pinctrl: pin-controller@48000000 {
        pin-controller;
        /* ... */
    };

    gpioa: gpio@40020000 {
        gpio-controller;
        compatible = "st,stm32-gpio-pinctrl";
        #gpio-cells = <2>;
        reg = <0x40020000 0x400>;
        label = "STM32_GPIOA";
        gpio-ranges = <&pinctrl GPIO_PORT_PIN0 PINCTRL_STM32_PINA0 16>;
    };


GPIO device driver implementation
*********************************

Driver configuration information comes from three sources:

- autoconf.h (Kconfig)
- generated_dts_board.h (device tree)
- soc.h

Driver configuration by autoconf
================================

See :ref:`configuration` for the the full set of Kconfig symbols that are available.
Specific to the GPIO driver are:

:c:macro:`CONFIG_GPIO`
    Enable GPIO driver.

Driver configuration by device tree
===================================

For a GPIO controller node the following information is extracted from the device tree
and provided in :file:`generated_dts_board.h`.

The general device information for GPIO controllers:

:c:macro:`SOC_GPIO_CONTROLLER_COUNT`
    Number of GPIO controllers that are activated. All nodes that contain a
    gpio-controller directive are counted.

:c:macro:`SOC_GPIO_CONTROLLER_0` ...
    The label prefix of GPIO controller 0 ... (e.g. 'ST_STM32_GPIO_PINCTRL_48000000').
    The define is generated if a gpio-controller directive is given in the node.

General information that is extracted for every device type:

**LABEL**

**BASE_ADDRESS**

**SIZE**

**COMPATIBLE_COUNT**

**COMPATIBLE_0_ID**

The specific device information for GPIO controllers:

**PINCTRL_CONTROLLER**
    For all pin controllers that are referenced in a pinctrl-x directive
    PINCTRL_CONTROLLER defines are generated.

**PINCTRL**
    For all subnodes of pin configurations referenced by active GPIO nodes
    - pinctrl-x(&xxx, pinconf_a, ...) - PINCTRL defines are generated.
    The pinctrl references the *PINCTRL_CONTROLLER* given in the pinctrl-x
    directive. The pinctrl also references the *PINCTRL_STATE* the pin
    controller associates to this pinctrl.

Driver configuration by soc.h
=============================

:file:`soc.h` may contain driver relevant information such as HAL header files.

Design Rationales
*****************

.. [#pin_number_space] GPIO uses a **local pin number space** instead of
   a global space to allow for object encapsulation.
