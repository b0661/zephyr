Purpose:
   Tree implementation in python

Description:
   The main features of treelib includes:
   - Simple to use in both python 2 and 3.
   - Efficient operation of node indexing with the benefit of dictionary type.
   - Support common tree operations like traversing, insertion, deletion, node moving, shallow/deep copying, subtree cutting etc.
   - Support user-defined data payload to accelerate your model construction.
   - Has pretty tree showing and text/json dump for pretty show and offline analysis

   EDTS needs an efficient tree data structure to represent the device tree.

   treelib is easy to use and is licensed Apache-2.0.

Dependencies:
   treelib depends only on standard Python libraries.

   treelib will be included in the edtsdb module as a replaceable componet to
   represent the tree data structure.
